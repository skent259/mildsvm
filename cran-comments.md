## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Thank you for the helpful suggestions. 
In this version I have:

  * remove "in R" and 
  * add "With Support Vector Machines" for more information.

* Edited DESCRIPTION to 
  * remove extra spaces,
  * add references from the package, and 
  * correct spelling of 'optimization'

* Added \value tag for the following .Rd files: as_mi_df.Rd, as_mild_df.Rd, 
  formatting.Rd

* Removed pipe (%>%) as an export, thus removing the problematic pipe.Rd file

* Added references to some documentation .Rd files
