\title{Sample mild_df object by bags and instances}
\usage{
bag_instance_sampling(data, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a 'mild_df' object containing the data}

\item{size}{a non-negative integer giving the number of rows to choose from
\code{data}.}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of length \code{size} indicating which rows were sampled.
}
\description{
From a 'mild_df' object, return a sample that evenly pulls from the unique
bags and unique instances from each bag as much as possible.  This is a form
of stratified sampling to avoid randomly sampling many rows from a few bags.
}
\examples{
mil_data <- mildsvm::generate_mild_df(positive_dist = "mvnormal",
                                      negative_dist = "mvnormal",
                                      remainder_dist = "mvnormal",
                                      nbag = 2,
                                      ninst = 2,
                                      nsample = 2)

rows <- bag_instance_sampling(mil_data, 6)
table(mil_data$bag_name[rows])
table(mil_data$instance_name[rows])

rows <- bag_instance_sampling(mil_data, 4)
table(mil_data$bag_name[rows])
table(mil_data$instance_name[rows])
