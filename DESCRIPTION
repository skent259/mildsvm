Description: mildsvm contains popular methods for training classifiers on 
    multiple-instance learning (MIL) data. A core feature of MIL data is that 
    instances are grouped into bags, and only the bag label is observed (in 
    contrast to supervised learning where all instances will have an instance 
    label).
