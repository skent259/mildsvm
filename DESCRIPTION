Description: Weakly supervised (WS), multiple instance (MI) data lives in 
    numerous interesting applications such as drug discovery, object 
    detection, and tumor prediction on whole slide images. The mildsvm
    package provides an easy way to learn from this data by training 
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifiers. It also contains 
    helpful functions for building and printing multiple instance data 
    frames.
